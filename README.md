# Super simple CLI todo app written in Rust

## Purpose

This is an app that I made just to practise writing Rust. It does not invent anything new. Just a silly little todo app.

## Synopsis

Get prompted > Choose what to do (add, list, delete, quit) > Receive result > Repeat (if did not quit)

## Features

- Adding tasks (saving task into a file)
- Listing tasks (reading tasks from a file)
- Deleting tasks (removing task from a file)

## todo (todo in todo app repo how ironic)
- [x] Have fun learning Rust and Git
- [ ] !!! Make the app arg-based instead of menu-based
- [ ] More features, for example, urgency and being able to mark tasks as done
- [ ] Formal language (? not sure)
- [ ] Optimisation?.. I don't know what else to put
