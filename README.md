# Super simple CLI todo app written in Rust

## Purpose

This is an app that I made just to practise writing Rust. It does not invent anything new. Just a silly little todo app.

## Synopsis

Add a task to the list:  
```todo-cli-app a/add "this is a task"```  

List tasks:  
```todo-cli-app l/list```

Remove a task from the list:  
```todo-cli-app d/delete 1```

## Features

- Adding tasks (saving task into a file)
- Listing tasks (reading tasks from a file)
- Deleting tasks (removing task from a file)
- Showing help message (best feature!!)

## todo (todo in todo app repo how ironic)
- [x] Have fun learning Rust and Git
- [x] !!! Make the app arg-based instead of menu-based
- [ ] More features, for example, urgency and being able to mark tasks as done
- [ ] Formal language (? not sure)
- [x] Optimisation?.. I don't know what else to put
